Tutorials
=========

The PySyft tutorials are written in ``Jupyter Notebooks`` in a hosted network environment that requires no setup. Follow the instructions to get started. 

    **Note:** This section is incomplete and currently in progress.

The best place to start is by ``identifying`` your ``role``. If you belong to an organization and would like to ``deploy`` your Domain, ``Domain Owner`` is a persona for you. ``Data scientists`` can start by ``installing`` Syft and ``connecting`` to a Domain. ``Data Engineers/ Developers`` can start setting up their ``development`` ``environment`` and then can explore different ``deployment`` options.
